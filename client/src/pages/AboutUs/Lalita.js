                My passion is in helping others and making a difference in any
                way I can. I find gratitude in helping others find solutions and
                I strive to make a memorable impact on others. I enjoy
                contributing this aspect to whomever I can and that’s what makes
                it different from a “have to do” to a “love to do.” I have
                experience with operations management; staff development;
                revenue management; expense and budget management; food &
                beverage operations; inventory management; merchandise
                administration; driving sales; leverage pricing; marketing; and
                social media marketing.

              <strong>Real Estate: </strong>I am the Co-Founder and Vice President of Limitless Estates, LLC. I am involved with all aspects of the company such as research, acquisitions, management, operations, and marketing, but have a specific focus on investor relations. I have been successful at raising over $300k to fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of 3 years during my time as a professional athlete. Through experience, I can highlight the fact that the importance of a company’s sponsorship success is defined by the end result being beneficial to both parties and the importance to have an alignment of passion and goals.

                <strong>Early Life: </strong>
                At a young age, I quickly learned the meaning of discipline and
                dedication. I picked up the game of golf when I was 10, was
                playing in competitive tournaments by the time I was 13, and by
                the time I was 17, I had traveled and competed in 34 of 50
                states.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-1">
                <strong>Education & Amateur Status: </strong>I attended UC
                Irvine on a full-ride athletic scholarship but was raised and
                believed to always put my academics first. I graduated from UC
                Irvine in June 2012 with a degree in Sociology and minor in
                Public Health. Out of my 4 years’ attendance, I was a 3-time
                Dean’s list honoree, 3-time Big West Scholar-Athlete, First Team
                All Big West, Big West Player of the Month in March 2012, led
                the nation in NCAA D1 Par 3 scoring average in 2009 and made UC
                Irvine history being selected for 2011 NCAA All-Star golf team.
                I ended my amateur career with a win at the 2012 Long Beach City
                Women’s Championship, which gave me the confidence boost to
                pursue golf at a higher level.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-1">
                <strong>Professional Career: </strong>I competed on the LPGA
                Symetra Tour, Cactus Tour and Canadian Tour. I got through my
                professional golf career by the help of sponsors and
                endorsements. Since golf is an individual sport, I worked hard
                to create an image for myself and be my own brand. I learned to
                represent myself in a way that would make sponsors interested to
                invest in me and my golf game. I was successful at raising over
                $300k to fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of 3
                years. Through experience, I can highlight the fact that the
                importance of a company’s sponsorship success is defined by the
                end result and being beneficial to both parties. In 2005, I
                appeared and competed on a reality TV show, Golf Channel’s
                Altered Course Montego Bay.

                <strong>Golf Industry: </strong>
                For the past 2 years, I have worked for Strato Partners as a
                Regional Sales Director and Assistant General Manager. Within
                this job, I have made myself familiar and competent with
                defining what is important in managing a $4 million+ business.
                Strato Partners make it a #1 priority to have each and every
                guest leave with a great customer experience.

                <strong>Other: </strong>I constantly set goals for myself,
                mentally and physically, and I persistently try to achieve them.
                I am continually learning to grow and improve as a person by
                pushing limits. I plan to work my way out of the golf industry
                and completely out of my comfort zone. I have found real estate
                to be my new quest and chase in life. I am driven and
                relentless, and these skills make me a valuable asset to my
                team. My goals for the future would be to become an all-around
                real estate expert, continually grow my portfolio and to be an
                entrepreneur duo with my fiancé. For me, it would be so special
                to be able to look back one day to see how far we’ve come and
                share the successes together.
