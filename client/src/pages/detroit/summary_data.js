      'Founded over 200 years ago, Detroit has always been known for its rich history and culture. From the expansion of the automobile industry in the early 20th century, Detroit’s population and economy was booming. After the 1950’s, the automobile industry slowly began to decline and with it went the population and economy. Fast forward to current days and Detroit is seeing a resurgence. Just a decade ago, Detroit was not somewhere anyone wanted to visit, let alone work in. Thanks in large part to Dan Gilbert for his investments in downtown, the Motor City as it is known to many, is booming again. Downtown Detroit is now not just a place to visit, but a desirable place to work in and invest in. With prices going through the roof in Detroit, the city has once again started expanding and buying in the right submarkets is crucial. Detroit is currently trading at an 8% Cap Rate with its average price per unit at just over $57K, and rising rents of 3% a year on average.',
      'Furthermore, Detroit was ranked #38 in the top 50 cities to invest in multifamily properties as well as #28 in the opportunity index according to the “2018 North American Multifamily Forecast” put out by Marcus and Millichap.  With Detroit seeing continual population, economic, and rental growth in the last few years, coupled with a dropping unemployment rate and affordable pricing, the time to invest in Detroit is now.'
